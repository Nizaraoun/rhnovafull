# Dynamic Task Management Implementation

## Overview
This implementation makes the task management system dynamic by integrating with the backend APIs for team management and task progress tracking.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. Services Created

#### `src/app/team-member/services/team-member.service.ts`
- Service for team members to interact with task and team APIs
- Endpoints:
  - `getMyTasks()` - Get tasks assigned to current user
  - `getTeamTasks()` - Get all team tasks for visibility
  - `updateTaskProgress()` - Update task progress percentage
  - `updateTaskStatus()` - Change task status
  - `getMyTeamDetails()` - Get detailed team information
  - `getMyTeamManager()` - Get team manager information

#### `src/app/manager/services/manager.service.ts`
- Service for managers to manage tasks and teams
- Endpoints:
  - `createTask()` - Create new tasks
  - `assignTask()` - Assign tasks to team members
  - `getMyTeamTasks()` - Get all team tasks
  - `getTasksByStatus()` - Filter tasks by status
  - `evaluateTask()` - Evaluate completed tasks
  - `deleteTask()` - Delete tasks
  - `getMyTeamDetails()` - Get team information with members

### 2. Components Updated

#### `src/app/team-member/tasks/my-tasks.component.ts`
- Integrated with TeamMemberService
- Dynamic task loading from API
- Real-time progress updates
- Status mapping between API and UI formats
- Fallback to mock data if API fails
- Loading states and error handling

#### `src/app/team-member/team/team-view.component.ts`
- Dynamic team information loading
- Integration with team API endpoints
- Team member data from backend
- Loading states for better UX

#### `src/app/manager/tasks/manager-tasks.component.ts`
- Complete rewrite to use ManagerService
- Dynamic task creation and assignment
- Team member loading from API
- Task filtering and management
- Progress tracking integration
- Loading states and error handling

#### `src/app/manager/progress/progress-tracking.component.ts`
- Dynamic progress data from tasks API
- Automatic team performance calculation
- Real-time progress metrics
- Team workload analysis

### 3. UI Enhancements

#### `src/app/shared/styles/loading.scss`
- Comprehensive loading states styling
- Status and priority badge styles
- Progress bar styling
- Responsive design
- Error state styling

#### Updated Component SCSS Files
- Added loading.scss imports to all relevant components
- Enhanced visual feedback for loading states

### 4. API Integration Features

#### Status Mapping
- Backend: `A_FAIRE`, `EN_COURS`, `TERMINEE`
- Frontend: `Pending`, `In Progress`, `Completed`

#### Priority Mapping
- Backend: `BASSE`, `MOYENNE`, `HAUTE`
- Frontend: `Low`, `Medium`, `High`

#### Data Flow
1. **Task Creation**: Manager creates task → API call → Optional assignment → UI update
2. **Progress Update**: Team member updates progress → API call → Status auto-update → UI refresh
3. **Team View**: Load team details → Display members → Show workload metrics
4. **Progress Tracking**: Aggregate task data → Calculate team performance → Display metrics

### 5. Error Handling
- Graceful fallback to mock data if API fails
- User-friendly error messages
- Loading states to prevent UI confusion
- Retry mechanisms for failed operations

### 6. Key Features Implemented

#### For Team Members:
- View assigned tasks dynamically
- Update task progress in real-time
- See team information and members
- Track personal task completion

#### For Managers:
- Create and assign tasks to team members
- Monitor team progress in real-time
- View detailed progress analytics
- Manage task lifecycle (create, assign, evaluate, delete)

### 7. API Endpoints Used

Based on the provided curl examples:

```bash
# Team Management
GET /api/equipes/my-team
GET /api/equipes/my-team/manager

# Task Management (Team Member)
GET /api/taches/member/my-tasks
GET /api/taches/member/team-tasks
PATCH /api/taches/member/{id}/progress?progression={value}
PATCH /api/taches/member/{id}/status?status={value}

# Task Management (Manager)
POST /api/taches/manager/create
POST /api/taches/manager/assign/{taskId}/{memberId}
GET /api/taches/manager/my-team-tasks
GET /api/taches/manager/team-tasks/status/{status}
PATCH /api/taches/manager/{id}/evaluate?evaluation={value}
GET /api/taches/details/{id}
```

### 8. Future Enhancements
- Real-time notifications for task updates
- Advanced filtering and sorting options
- Task comments and attachments
- Time tracking integration
- Calendar integration for due dates
- Automated progress reporting
- Team collaboration features

## Usage

### Team Member Workflow:
1. Login → View "My Tasks" → See assigned tasks from API
2. Click "Update Progress" → Modify percentage → Submit to API
3. View "Team" → See team members and their workload from API

### Manager Workflow:
1. Login → "Manage Tasks" → See all team tasks from API
2. "Create Task" → Fill form → Submit to API → Optionally assign to member
3. "Progress Tracking" → View real-time team analytics from API data

All data is now dynamically loaded from the backend APIs with proper error handling and loading states for a professional user experience.
